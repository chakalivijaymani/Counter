# Counter
 In this counter project we are going to add a count displayer by using buttons as increase ,decrease and reset button.And also we have assign the colors for count also if the value is increasing means the count value must be in green color,if it decreasing means it is in the red color ans if zero nothing but reset means it is in the black color.
